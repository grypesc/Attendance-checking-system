# Attendance-checking-system

This system can be used to check attendance of students during a class. After the server is turned on, it will wait for a random amount of time (for test purposes from 5 to 10 seconds) until it starts accepting connections.  Then a client can connect and send his/her name and a surname. This information will be stored in a list implemented on a server. The system checks whether client’s input is correct or not. Multiple client connections can be handled thanks to creating a new thread for each one of them. Every new name and surname are added to the list and before server shuts down it saves the list to a “.txt” file. Server will accept connections only for a certain time that is defined by macro ACCEPTINGTIME. We handle signals and interruptions to provide functionalities that are not possible without them, like stopping accept function after given time.
